## 2. Technical Decisions Log (TDL)

### [TDL-001] Strict Multi-Repo Analysis Before Code Refinement
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: The CTO mandate requires eliminating redundant architectural buildup across company projects. Jumping directly into coding the boilerplate without analyzing all company and industry benchmarks risks missed components and architectural drift.
- **Decision**: No boilerplate code mutation will occur until all candidate repositories are analyzed and cataloged into `analysis/<repo_name>/` directories.
- **Consequences**: Guarantees comprehensive capture of company-specific business logic, auth requirements, and utility modules.

### [TDL-002] Modular Architecture with Pluggable Core Subsystems
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Different company projects may require varying combinations of features (e.g., some need WebSockets, some need queues, some need multi-tenancy).
- **Decision**: The master architecture is structured around 10 distinct, loosely-coupled pillars adhering to Clean / Hexagonal Architecture principles.
- **Consequences**: Modules can be enabled or configured without rewiring the entire application core.

### [TDL-003] Human-Centric Git Commit Message Protocol
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Team preference mandates natural, human-written commit messages and eliminates robotic prefixes (`feat:`, `chore:`, `agent:`).
- **Decision**: All commits must use clear, concise human phrasing (e.g., "Add initial memory architecture and guidelines").
- **Consequences**: Clearer commit history aligned with team workflow standards.

### [TDL-004] Standardized Multi-Repo Analysis Schema
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: To compare disparate company repositories and global boilerplates systematically, analysis directories must adhere to a uniform structure.
- **Decision**: Every analyzed repository gets `analysis/<repo_name>/` containing `<repo_name>_analysis.md`, `arch_analysis.md`, and `extracted_components/`.
- **Consequences**: Streamlines final synthesis phase and component reusability.

### [TDL-005] Shadcn UI Exclusivity and Modernization Mandate
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Direct requirement from project leadership (Abrsh) mandates using exclusively Shadcn UI, updated to the newest practices (Radix UI primitives + CVA + Tailwind CSS v4 tokens).
- **Decision**: Discard all ad-hoc UI libraries. Standardize the boilerplate UI layer strictly around modern Shadcn UI primitives located under `src/components/ui/`.
- **Consequences**: Unifies styling, ensures high accessibility compliance, and simplifies component maintenance across company projects.

### [TDL-006] Component Decoupling & Independent Composability
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Flagship projects (like TefTef) have tight couplings between UI components and domain-specific Redux slices or routes.
- **Decision**: Harvested components (e.g., `DataTable`, `PaginationControls`, `ProfilePreparingWait`, `MatchScore`, `AnimatedGlassPageBackground`) will be decoupled into self-contained components with pure TypeScript props during the final synthesis phase.
- **Consequences**: Any new Fanaye project will be able to import and use these components without requiring domain-specific state baggage.

### [TDL-007] Zero-Shadow Tonal Hierarchy & Border-Led Elevation
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: High-density financial applications suffer from visual clutter and muddy interfaces when heavy drop shadows are applied to dense grids and cards.
- **Decision**: Standardize on `fin-core`'s zero-shadow architecture: warm canvas cream (`#faf9f7`) background, pure white (`#ffffff`) card bodies with `shadow-none`, surface ivory (`#fbfaf7`) grouping headers/footers, and crisp 1px hairline (`#efefef`) borders.
- **Consequences**: Clean, modern, editorial aesthetic with zero blur lag and superior optical legibility.

### [TDL-008] Refresh Token Single In-Flight Promise Deduplication
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: When a token expires, multiple parallel client requests trigger simultaneous refresh calls. With single-use refresh tokens, the second call fails, logging the user out.
- **Decision**: Implement a single module-level `refreshPromise` in the auth network layer that all concurrent callers await until resolution.
- **Consequences**: Eliminates 401 refresh race conditions and prevents premature session invalidation.

### [TDL-009] Tailwind v4 Spacing Injection Constraint
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: In Tailwind CSS v4, defining custom spacing like `--spacing-8: 8px` under `@theme` overrides all standard sizing utilities (e.g., `h-8`, `w-8`, `size-8`), breaking Shadcn sidebars and avatars.
- **Decision**: Custom spacing scale variables must strictly live in `:root` as plain CSS properties and never be declared under `@theme`.
- **Consequences**: Prevents catastrophic layout collapses across all Shadcn UI components.

### [TDL-010] Modern Shadcn `base-nova` & Container-Query Form System
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Traditional form layouts break when placed in sidebars, popovers, or narrow modals. Moreover, classic Radix primitives add runtime bulk compared to newer Base UI implementations.
- **Decision**: Adopt Shadcn `base-nova` with `@base-ui/react` primitives and standardized `data-slot` markup. Standardize form composition on the container-query enabled `Field` system (`FieldSet`, `FieldGroup`, `Field`, `FieldError`) for automatic responsiveness across all contexts.
- **Consequences**: Provides seamless responsiveness inside modals, sidebars, and full-screen layouts with built-in accessible error deduplication.

### [TDL-011] Dual-Process NestJS Architecture & Thread-Local Device Context
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Monolithic Node.js backends that handle heavy asynchronous tasks (emails, PDF contract generation, license verification) alongside HTTP requests suffer latency spikes and API timeouts under load.
- **Decision**: Separate the backend into dual processes: `main.ts` (API Web Server) and `main-worker.ts` (BullMQ Standalone Application Context). Capture client device metadata at the Express boundary using Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` (`requestDeviceContext`) for multi-device session tracking without parameter pollution.
- **Consequences**: Zero HTTP latency degradation during asynchronous spikes; effortless multi-device session auditing across all services.

### [TDL-012] Enterprise IAM Defense-in-Depth & Password Lifecycle
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Legacy applications often rely on outdated bcrypt hashing without breach detection or sequence checking, exposing user accounts to credential stuffing.
- **Decision**: Standardize on Argon2id with automatic transparent re-hashing of legacy bcrypt hashes upon login. Enforce Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) k-anonymity breach verification with network fail-open, sequence similarity checks, and native WebAuthn/Passkey registration.
- **Consequences**: Bank-grade password security and friction-free user authentication.

### [TDL-013] PostgreSQL & Prisma 7 Hexagonal Persistence as Fanaye Standard
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Global benchmarks explore Drizzle, TypeORM, and Prisma. However, analysis of Fanaye's production codebases confirms that PostgreSQL managed through Prisma 7 (`@prisma/client` + `@prisma/adapter-pg`) under a strict Hexagonal / Clean Architecture (pure domain entities, abstract repository ports, and dedicated two-way mappers) is the company standard.
- **Decision**: Standardize backend persistence exclusively on PostgreSQL + Prisma 7 within a Hexagonal repository structure. Business domains must never import `@prisma/client` directly.
- **Consequences**: Type-safe migrations, zero ORM vendor lock-in in business logic, and consistency across all company engineering teams.

### [TDL-014] Three-Tier Agentic Guidance & Skill Architecture
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Modern engineering teams rely on AI coding assistants (Antigravity, Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot). Without explicit structuring, AI assistants invent ad-hoc patterns or violate architectural constraints.
- **Decision**: Structure the boilerplate with a 3-tier AI guidance architecture:
  1. Root `AGENTS.md` (universal briefing & guardrails).
  2. Modular Antigravity `.agents/skills/` (on-demand capability playbooks for domain generation, UI components, and safe migrations).
  3. Scoped `frontend/AGENTS.md` and `backend/AGENTS.md` to prevent cross-stack confusion.
- **Consequences**: Ensures AI agents generate consistent, production-grade code adhering strictly to Fanaye conventions.

### [TDL-015] The Seven Core Fanaye Agent Skills Suite
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Drawing from global skill directories (skills.sh, AgenticSkills, VoltAgent, finfin/awesome-frontend-skills, jakubkrehel/skills), AI agents require domain-specific operational skills rather than generic prompts to avoid architectural regressions.
- **Decision**: Define and standardize seven company-specific skills under `.agents/skills/`:
  1. `1-shadcn-base-nova` (Base UI, data-slot, container-query forms, DayPicker v10)
  2. `2-zero-shadow-elevation` (Sunlit Cream, pure white cards, hairline borders, no muddy drop shadows)
  3. `3-create-domain-slice` (Full-stack DDD vertical slices synchronized across frontend and backend)
  4. `4-hexagonal-persistence` (Prisma 7 domain isolation via ports and mappers)
  5. `5-enterprise-iam-defense` (Argon2id, HIBP k-anonymity, 2FA TOTP, Passkeys, refresh promise deduplication)
  6. `6-async-bullmq-worker` (Dedicated BullMQ worker, Redis resilience with maxRetriesPerRequest: null)
  7. `7-safe-db-migration` (Accidental data-loss prevention, non-destructive schema migrations)
- **Consequences**: Guarantees that any AI coding assistant automatically adheres to Fanaye Technologies' engineering, UI/UX, security, and persistence standards.

### [TDL-016] Dual-Stack Monorepo Foundation & Root Orchestration
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Project requires independent development and deployment of Next.js frontend and NestJS backend while maintaining unified scripts, shared Docker configurations, and synchronized domain slices.
- **Decision**: Reorganize workspace into `frontend/` and `backend/` with root npm workspaces, concurrently dev orchestration, unified Docker Compose (PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7), and centralized AI governance (`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Consequences**: Clear separation of concerns, zero dependency pollution between React 19 frontend and NestJS 11 backend, while enabling single-command dev workflows (`npm run dev`).

### [TDL-017] Decoupled Domain Persistence via Abstract Ports & Mappers
- **Date**: 2026-10-03
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Directly injecting PrismaService into NestJS services creates tight ORM vendor lock-in, complicates unit testing, and violates Fanaye company standards.
- **Decision**: All domain slices (`users`, `transactions`, `dashboard`) must declare pure domain models without `@prisma/client` types, abstract repository classes as injection tokens, and separate two-way mappers (`*-prisma.mapper.ts`) inside relational infrastructure modules.
- **Consequences**: Business logic is 100% decoupled from ORM implementation details; unit tests can easily mock repository ports; zero runtime leak of database specifics into service contracts.

### [TDL-018] Enterprise IAM Defense & Asynchronous Queue Isolation
- **Date**: 2026-10-03
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Applications must defend against credential stuffing, multi-device session fraud, and API latency spikes caused by synchronous email/PDF rendering.
- **Decision**: Standardize on Argon2id hashing with transparent bcrypt migration, HIBP k-anonymity check, TOTP 2FA, WebAuthn passkeys, AsyncLocalStorage device tracking, and standalone BullMQ worker processes.
- **Consequences**: High-assurance IAM security, zero API event-loop latency degradation from background tasks.

### [TDL-019] Modern Shadcn base-nova Primitive Suite & Composite Micro-UI Components
- **Date**: 2026-10-03
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Legacy UI primitives often suffer from heavy box shadows, inaccessible nested button hierarchies, missing container queries, and fragmented design tokens across financial dashboards and modals.
- **Decision**: Standardize frontend exclusively on Shadcn `base-nova` style with `@base-ui/react` and `data-slot` markup. Reject legacy `@radix-ui/react-slot` `asChild` in favor of native `render` props. Enforce Sunlit Cream Zero-Shadow tonal hierarchy (`#faf9f7` canvas, `#ffffff` card bodies with `shadow-none`, `#fbfaf7` grouping bars, `1px` `#efefef` hairline borders, and DeltaChip light-tint badges). Deliver reusable composite micro-UI: `GlobalSearchModal` (Cmd+K Spotlight), `MembershipQR` (halo pass), `ShareButton` (OS touch share sheet), `OnboardingStepper` (tabular counter), `ProfilePreparingWait` (easing tabular ticker), and `LegalDocument`.
- **Consequences**: 100% type-safe, ultra-crisp high-density presentation with zero visual clutter, container-query responsiveness, and full accessibility compliance.

### [TDL-020] Synchronized DDD Vertical Slices & Interactive Views
- **Date**: 2026-10-03
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Boilerplates often provide only static skeleton placeholders without realistic enterprise business workflows, leaving engineers to design auth forms, onboarding flows, and financial dashboards from scratch.
- **Decision**: Deliver fully functional interactive domain slices across `frontend/src/domains/`:
  - `domains/auth/`: Interactive SignIn with quick-fill demo roles (`admin@fanaye.com`, `dev@fanaye.com`), SignUp with real-time password criteria pills and HIBP notice, and TOTP 2FA challenge modal.
  - `domains/onboarding/`: 5-step wizard with tabular stepper, currency selection, passkey enrollment, legal agreement sign-off, and easing percentage loader.
  - `domains/dashboard/`: Financial command center with 4 KPI cards, SVG sparklines, 12-month cashflow AreaChart via Shadcn `ChartContainer` + Recharts, recent transactions table with multi-status filters, and digital pass.
  - `domains/admin/`: User directory table with role badges, status pills, device counts, and administrative toggle actions.
- **Consequences**: Out-of-the-box functional experience with realistic sample data aligned with backend Prisma seeds and zero compile warnings.

### [TDL-021] The Seven Core Agent Skills & Enterprise Production Orchestration
- **Date**: 2026-10-03
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Context**: Autonomous AI coding agents operating across multiple monorepo workspaces require standardized, executable playbooks to prevent architectural drift, accidental data loss, or style regressions. Production deployment requires deterministic containerization.
- **Decision**: Author the Seven Core Fanaye Skills in `.agents/skills/` (`1-shadcn-base-nova` through `7-safe-db-migration`), author scoped governance files `frontend/AGENTS.md` and `backend/AGENTS.md`, implement Hygen relational resource generator in `backend/_templates/`, deliver multi-stage Alpine Dockerfiles for both services, configure root `docker-compose.yml` with healthchecks, and deliver the master `README.md`.
- **Consequences**: Enterprise-grade developer experience, reproducible container deployments, automated DDD slice generation, and guaranteed adherence by any AI agent to Fanaye Technologies' engineering standards.
